Yi-hack project
===============

Forked from fritz-smh/yi-hack.

Purpose
=======

This project is a collection of scripts and binaries file to hack your Xiaomi Yi Ants camera.

![Alt text](yi.jpg?raw=true "Yi camera")

This camera has the default following features :
* wifi
* night vision
* motion detection : a video file is generated if a motion have been detected in the last 60 seconds.
* send video data over the network on Chinese servers in the cloud to allow people to view camera data from their smartphone wherever they are.
* setup thanks to a smartphone application.
* local video storage on a SD card
* no RTSP server in the last firmwares

This hack includes :
* ntpclient (set date and time over internet)
* Base firmware is : M release.
* no more cloud feature (nothing goes out of your local network)
* no more need to use a smartphone application
* RTSP server activated
* Telnet server activated
* HTTP server activated
* FTP server activated
* No more (chinese) voices on startup

Warning about some models that are usable only in China
=======================================================

If you have some issues to use your camera, even without this firmware, please read this webpage : https://diy.2pmc.net/solved-xiaomi-xiao-yi-ant-home-camera-can-used-china/ (more information about users issues here : https://github.com/fritz-smh/yi-hack/issues/8 )

Installation on the Yi camera
=============================

The memory card must stay in the camera ! If you remove it, the camera will start without using the hack.

Prepare the memory card
-----------------------

Clone this repository on a computer :

    git clone http://github.com/chautruongthinh/yi-hack.git

Then, format a micro SD card in fat32 (vfat) format and copy the content of the **yi-hack/sd/** folder at the root of your memory card.

The memory card will so contain :

* home : the official firmware file compliant with this hack
* test : the folder which contains the hack scripts and binaries
* record : this folder will only be created when some video records will be added on the memory card by the camera
* record_sub : this folder will only be created when some video records will be added on the memory card by the camera

Configure the Yi camera on the memory card
------------------------------------------

You will need to set a static IP adresse to the camera. To check for the available IPs on your network, you can use the **Fing** application to scan the network on your Android smartphone.

To configure the wifi network to use, edit the file **test/wpa_supplicant.conf**.

To configure your IP address, open the file **test/yi-hack.cfg** and set the values.

Start the camera
----------------

* If plugged, unplug the Yi camera
* Insert the memory card in the Yi camera
* Plug the Yi camera

The camera will start. The led will indicate the current status :
* yellow : camera startup
* blue blinking : network configuration in progress (connec to wifi, set up the IP address)
* blue : network configuration is OK. Camera is ready to use.

You can test is your camera is up and running this hack with your browser on url **http://ip/**. You should see this page :

![Alt text](http_server.png?raw=true "Yi camera HTTP server")

Warning : changes done on the original camera filesystem
--------------------------------------------------------

One change is needed on the camera filesystem which will not be reverted by removing the memory card : the file **/home/timeout.g726** is renamed to **/home/timeout.g726.OFF**.

This is done because a process (rmm) tries to connect to the cloud process without success (as it is not started) and raise the play of a chinese voice timeout file. If this file would not be renamed, you would be bothered with this message.


How can I know which is the version of a firmware 'home' file ?
===============================================================

Just do : **strings home  | grep version**. Example :

    $ strings home  | grep 1.8.5
    version=1.8.5.1M_201512011815


Use the camera
==============

Domogik
-------

You can easily use the Yi camera with the Domogik (http://www.domogik.org) home automation solution. You just need to install the **domogik-plugin-yi** package.

Access the video stream over RTSP
---------------------------------

RTSP server is on port 554.

You can access the video over RTSP on 3 urls :
* High definition video and audio (h264) : http://ip:554/ch0_0.h264
* Low definition video and audio (h264) : http://ip:554/ch0_1.h264
* Audio (h264) : http://ip:554/ch0_3.h264

There is no login and password and currently no way to set it.

Access the history of motion detection
--------------------------------------

Each time a motion is detected, the camera will generate a video file (60s max). This file is stored on the memory card and can be accessed over :
* http server
* ftp server

The simplest way is to browse the file from the http server.

To know if a motion have been detected in the last minute, you can check the url http://ip/motion (GET). It can give :
* when no motion is detected : an empty content
* when motion is detected : a file path to the video file from the root of the http server

Telnet server
-------------

The telnet server is on port 23.

Default login/password :
* login = root
* password = 1234qwer (unless you specified another password in yi-hack.cfg file)

Ftp server
----------

The ftp server is on port 21.

There is no login/password required.


I want more !
=============

Some scripts are provided in the **sd/test/scripts** folder. Please read the **README.md** file in this folder for more informations.

Uninstall the hack
==================

First, remove the SD card. But keep in mind that the timeout sound has been altered.

If you want the timeout sound back:
Edit equip_test.sh to look like this:

    #!/bin/sh
    ######################################################
    # Xiaomi Yi hack restore
    ######################################################

    ### Rename back the timeout sound file ...
    [ -f /home/timeout.g726.OFF ] && mv /home/timeout.g726.OFF /home/timeout.g726

    sync

Then reboot the camera so the script runs. After remove the stuff from sd card and you are all original.


How it works ?
==============

Hack content
------------

```
home                           Official firmware
test/                          Yi hack folder

  equip_test.sh                This script is called on camera startup and will launch all the needed processes
  check_motion.sh              This script will check each minute if a motion video has been recorded and fill the **motion** file of the http server
  rtspsrvK|L|M                 The various RTSP server binary releases (the final letter is corresponding to the firmware)

  log.txt                      Log file of the hack (filled by equip_test.sh)
````


equip_test.sh
-------------

**TODO**

check_motion.sh
---------------

Script that runs from equip_test.sh and tell us if a new video was created in the last minute (a video file is created in case of motion detection).

If a file is found, it adds the name of the file to the section GET /motion on the http server.
